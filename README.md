Datanaut AB is a technology company specializing in the development of digital tools for project management in space-related research initiatives and advanced engineering projects.
The company collaborates with both private sector partners and public research institutions.
To streamline internal project management, Datanaut is developing a new database solution that will serve as the foundation for a future web-based platform.

### Technologys
- SQL
- C#
- Visual studio
- SQL server management studio (SSMS)

### Design
The project design is based on the ER diagram created in ERDplus. We used a "Database First" approach with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
to create the database, and then implemented data exchange using Entity Framework for sending and receiving data.
